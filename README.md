# Healthcare-Management-Database
Normally, hospitals and medical offices would store their patient data in a traditional file system such as Microsoft Excel, Open office (compatible with windows, MAC, Linux) or Google doc spreadsheets. The major drawback of using such a file system is that the data is apart of the application program which works only with a specific type of application that all users must be trained to use. This healthcare management database is created to store data records of OBGYN patients with gynecological cancers, patient assessment, and treatment information. This database will provide an important way of monitoring and improving the value of healthcare services which will result in better patient care.
